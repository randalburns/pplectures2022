    "# Exercise 4 - Introducing Actors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how to create stateful actors and call their methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, please see the documentation on actors: http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/actors.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Although remote functions are useful for parallelizing stateless computations, sometimes your workload requires maintaining state across invocations. Some examples might be a simple counter, a neural network during training, or a simulator environment. If using remote functions, you would have to pass this state into each function invocation and return the updated state when it finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Ray comes with a stateful abstraction for these situations: remote actors. An actor is a lot like a Python object - it is initialized with an `__init__` function (that has the same features has remote tasks), and can contain internal state that is accessed and mutated by remote method calls. Remote method calls will be executed one at a time on each actor, so there's no need to worry about race conditions on the actor's state. To achieve more parallelism, multiple actors can be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remote Actors\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an actor, decorate a Python class with the `@ray.remote` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "class Example(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def set(self, x):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def get(self):\n",
    "        return self.x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Like regular Python classes, **actors encapsulate state that is shared across actor method invocations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actor classes differ from regular Python classes in the following ways.\n",
    "1. **Instantiation:** A regular class would be instantiated via `e = Example(1)`. Actors are instantiated via\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    e = Example.remote(1)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    When an actor is instantiated, a **new process** is created somewhere in the cluster and the actor __init__ method is run in that process.\n",
    "2. **Method Invocation:** Methods of a regular class would be invoked via `e.set(2)` or `e.get()`. Actor methods are invoked using remote task syntax.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    >>> e.set.remote(2)\n",
    "    ObjectID(d966aa9b6486331dc2257522734a69ff603e5a1c)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> e.get.remote()\n",
    "    ObjectID(7c432c085864ed4c7c18cf112377a608676afbc3)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. **Return Values:** Actor methods are non-blocking. They immediately return an object ID and **create a task that is scheduled on the actor**. The result can be retrieved with `ray.get`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    >>> ray.get(e.set.remote(2))\n",
    "    None\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> ray.get(e.get.remote())\n",
    "    2\n",
