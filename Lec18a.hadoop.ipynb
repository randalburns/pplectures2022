    "## Hadoop! A First Example\n",
    "\n",

    "* Hadoop programs are written in Java (natively)\n",
    "  * Compiled and packed into a Java archive file.\n",
    "* The Hadoop executable takes a jar archive and submits it to the engine\n",
    "  * You should think about this as a job submission engine, similar to HPC schedulers.\n",
    "* Hadoop takes **HDFS** file paths as input and write **HDFS** files as output\n",
    "  * These are actually local file system paths.....more on this later.\n",
