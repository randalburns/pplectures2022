    "* To run a Java thread, you define a `Thread` object and call `start()` on the object.\n",
    "    * the `Thread` class takes a `Runnable` object in it's constructor\n",
    "* `Runnable` is an interface that any class can implement\n",
    "  * must include a `run` method as an entry point.\n",
    "* `thread.start()` is the fork/exec analogy\n",
    "  * it returns immediately in the calling thread\n",
    "  * and invokes `Runnable.run()` in a new thread\n",

    "The following is a minimal example for creating parallel threads in Java.  \n",

    "**Small Caution** Java has multiple ways to create threads.  The other way (not shown) is to inherit from or extend the `Thread` class.  This is inferior. Because `Thread` is a class, you cannot extend `Thread` and another class, e.g. `Applet`.  Good practice is to only inherit when you want to extend base class functionality.  That's not what we're doing.\n",
