    "\n",
    "An actor is associated with a decorated `@ray.remote` class. When you define an actor, you get a runtime handle (object identifier) to the actor. That handle provides access to all methods and state within the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the methods within the class are `remote()`. You should think of this as\n",
    "  * the actor is assigned to a compute resource \n",
    "  * function calls package arguments (and other needed state) and ships it to the remote resource\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with actors, you should try to have your remote calls be as minimal as possible and keep state within the actor at all times. I.e., try not to send a lot of state across actors.\n",
    "  \n",
    "So here is the class.  NB--I implemented this in PyCharm and moved it over. It's too complicated a piece of code for Jupyter. I need a lot of debugging support.\n",
