    "    * More transistors has become more cores (independent processing units on the same chip)\n",
    "    * Pipelined multicore (N k-flop cores) are not as useful as a big (Nk flop) processor\n",
    "    * In 2004, a 'processor' turned into a parallel computer (Itanium 2)\n",
    "* But the chip vendors tell us we have faster processors, not parallel computers\n",
    "  * So we (the programmers) must write parallel code to make software faster on multiple cores with the same clock speed and number of transistors\n",

    "### Dennard Scaling: Why the Big Lie\n",
    "\n",
    "As transistors get smaller their power density stays constant so that power is in proportion with area.\n",
    "Thus, voltage and current must scale downward.\n",
    "* Performance per watt increases exponentially \n",
    "* Smaller transistors lead to faster clock rates\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Dennard scaling ended in 2006. At the same time as the advent of multicore.\n",
    "* But Moore’s law still alive\n",
    "* Absent Dennard scaling, only choice was to turn to multicore processors\n",
