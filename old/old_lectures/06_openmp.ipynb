    "  * Video: data delays produce jitter, stalls\n",
    "  * Web: page render time causes user loss, discomfort\n",
    "  * Batch processing, indexing, analysis not completing in time \n",
    "  * High-throughput finance: other models running faster and beating mine to a decision -> lose arbitrage opportunity\n",
    "* This leads to a natural software engineering process\n",
    "  * Profile code: find out what’s slow\n",
