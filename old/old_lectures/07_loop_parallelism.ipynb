    "Loop parallelism is a form of parallelism and _programming pattern_ that derives parallel tasks from the iterations of loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most common use and programming pattern for OpenMP\n",
    "  * add parallel directives to a for loop\n",
    "  * OpenMP divides the loops iterations into _chunks_ assigned to threads\n",
    "* Merits of loop parallelism\n",
    "  * __Sequential equivalence__: parallel program is equivalent to a serial program (easy to write and maintain, good tools)\n",
    "  * __Refactoring__: Incremental conversion of a serial program to a parallel program (easy to test and debug)\n",
    "* Drawbacks of loop parallelism\n",
    "  * __Memory utilization__: if loop access patterns don’t match cache hierarchy, programs often require massive restructuring\n",
