    "### Synchronization and Thread Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncontrolled reading and writing of shared variables leads to unpredictable outcomes.  Reading and writing without synchronization leads to __race conditions__ in which computations produce different results depending the order in which threads are executed by the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/m7HYo.png\" width=512 title=\"Race Condition\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem arises because `x = x + 1` is actually multiple operations.  Each thread:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "reads value of x for memory\n",
    "updates local copy of x\n",
    "writes local copy to memory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions lead to bugs when one of the outcomes is undesirable.  It is the job of the programmer to __explicitly order__ operations so that bugs do not arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Thread safety__ is the idea that functions can be called from multiple threads concurrently and will produce correct results.  When you synchronize your code, it should be thread safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at several constructs for synchronization in Java:\n",
    "  * `synchronized` blocks\n",
    "  * the volatile keyword\n",
    "  * `Atomic` variables \n",
    "\n",
    "The most frequent and useful operation is to place a `synchronize` block around racing operations.  This synchronization creates a __critical section__ of code."
