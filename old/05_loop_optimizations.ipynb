    "For 2-d dense data, the array must be serialized to memory, i.e. in a linear order.\n",

    "  * Successive loop iterations access strided elements\n",

    "Our examples do indexing in row-major order `array[x*DIM+y]`\n",
    "  * placing y in the inner loop leads to sequential access\n",

    "There are many conventions about loop ordering and they get confusing.  Reason carefully about how the loops variables are enumerated and the data layout.  E.g., images are almost always in Fortran order so that programming then in C looks weird."
