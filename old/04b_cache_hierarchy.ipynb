    "* __cache line__: data are moved among levels in the cache one line at a time\n",
    "  * as small as 64 bytes (L1 or L2)\n",
    "  * think of each load as the parallel load of an entire line\n",
    "  * good parallel programs will use as 64 bytes\n",
    "* __unified__: refers to whether or not the cache is shared (among cores or processors)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other concepts that don't matter as much.\n",
    "* __inclusive vs exclusive__: has implications for hardware management policies.  We don't care.\n",
    "  * __inclusive__: data in higher level caches are also in lower level caches\n",
    "  * __exclusive__: data in higher level caches are not in lower level caches\n",
    "* __associativity__: the number of hardware locations that a cache line can go into\n",
    "  * important for HW design.  We typically don't care until we get to CUDA."

    "\n",
    "LMBench is a suite of performance benchmarking tools written by Carl Staelin and Larry McVoy in 1996. The strided access benchmark still provides the best insight into the structure of cache latencies.  The experiment does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Access a single byte at 128 byte strides (i.e. 0, 128, 256, 384, ...) for an array of a specified size.  Loop over the array multiple times to amortize any initial load costs.\n",

    "\n",
    "For arrays that fit into:\n",
    "  * L1 cache: the L1 cache that contains the entire array and each byte can be accessed in a single clock cycle\n",
    "  * L2 cache but not L1 cache: every byte access transfers a line from the L2 cache to the L1 cache. (Lines are 128 bytes). Each access occurs at L2 latency\n",
    "  * L3 cache but not L2 cache: every byte access transfers a line from L3->L2->L1.\n",
    "  * Larger than L3: performance increases as a function of the working set size. The operating system manages this cache and has access to predictive prefetching and other optimizations.\n",
    "    \n",
