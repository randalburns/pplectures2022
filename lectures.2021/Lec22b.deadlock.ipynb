    "  * MPI messaging is synchronous and blocking\n",

    "   * So `MPI_Send` can return immediately\n",
    "* MPI is not required to buffer messages\n",
    "    * and does not do so when memory is limited\n",
    "* This leads to horrible errors\n",
    "  * Because semantics/correctness change based on job configuration.\n",
    "  * You develop program on small cluster\n",
    "      * Has plenty of memory for small instances\n",
