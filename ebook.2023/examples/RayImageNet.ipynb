    "The file [resnet50.py](resnet50.py) shows how simple it is to run computer vision, deep learning models. It loads a pre-trained model  and the parameters needed to normalize input images in the constructor.  The function `classify_image` normalizes the image to a tensor, evaluates the tensor on the model, and then extracts the class names for the top predictions.\n",

    "This is a serial implementation in that one object runs in a single thread. It could be parallelize in many ways.  We could use `joblib` to create multiple processes. In this case, we are going to use `ray` to build a set of distributed actors. The concept is to instantiate a series of actors each of which has loaded the model. This loading is a one-time cost on instantiation. We can then call remote functions on the actors to classify images. The actors stay around and act as service centers for parallel work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ray implementation in [rayresnet50.py](rayresnet50.py) is the exact same code. It differs only in that it has the `@ray.remote` decorator to indicate that the object will be run as a Ray actor. Most of the complexity lies in the driver code that must launch the remote functions on the actors and complete them asynchronously."
